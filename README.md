Backflow Prevention Device Installation Density and Testing Compliance Trends in South Florida Residential Zones

This dataset evaluates how residential backflow prevention device installation density correlates with annual testing compliance trends across South Florida neighborhoods. Rather than focusing on commercial systems alone, this dataset examines residential irrigation tie-ins, secondary water sources, and mixed municipal connections that may require backflow protection.
Backflow prevention devices are designed to protect potable water supplies from contamination caused by reverse flow events. In regions with irrigation systems, reclaimed water connections, and seasonal property occupancy, installation density and testing regularity may influence system integrity. This dataset organizes aggregated compliance patterns to highlight operational and inspection dynamics in residential environments.
